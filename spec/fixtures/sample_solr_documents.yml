  - In choosing Colors for candy, certain qualifications are necessary. First, they must not fade or change when exposed to the light. Second, they must not be easily affected by acids or alkalies; hence, it has been difficult to produce colors that are reasonably permanent and at the same time harmless. Yet the following will be found as near perfect as any yet produced.

  - Twelve pounds of sugar, two quarts of water, stir until dissolved, then add one full teaspoon of cream of tartar, (or if you wish to use glucose, add three pounds of same, do this when you are weighing your sugar, by hollowing out a place in the center of the sugar and pouring in the glucose). Now put on the steamer and let it remain until the batch begins to cook, then remove; in this way all the grains of sugar adhereing to the sides of the basin are washed down.
